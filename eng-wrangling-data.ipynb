    "# Data Analysis: Educational Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Data Analysis Lab! In this educational project, we aim to explore crucial concepts that form the foundation of data manipulation and analysis. This project is based on the <a href='https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python'>Data Analysis with Python</a> course on the Coursera platform. The topic discussed here relates to the second week of the course and involves the practical application of concepts using a dataset collected from Kaggle: <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shariful07/student-mental-health'>Student Mental health</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this project, we will have acquired essential skills to handle missing data, adjust data types as needed, standardize and normalize relevant attributes, visualize data through <a href='#4'>grouped bar charts using binning</a>, and convert categorical data into numerical indicator variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "We sincerely thank Coursera for providing not only a comprehensive and accessible educational platform but also for offering financial support (<a href='https://www.coursera.org/financial-aid'>financial aid</a>) that enables participation in several courses. We express our deep gratitude to the community, whose sharing of knowledge and mutual support significantly enriches the learning experience for everyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "## <a href='#1'>Handling Missing Data</a>\n",
    "Robust data analysis requires the ability to effectively deal with missing data. There are various approaches to this challenge, from <a href='#1'>excluding incomplete entries</a> to <a href='#1'>imputing missing values</a>. We will explore these techniques, highlighting their applications and practical considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## <a href='#2'>Data Type Correction</a>\n",
    "Consistency in data types is crucial. In this lab, we will learn to <a href='#2'>identify and correct inappropriate data types</a>, ensuring that each variable is correctly interpreted. This is essential to avoid analysis errors and misinterpretation of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## <a href='#3'>Standardization and Normalization</a>\n",
    "Standardizing and normalizing data are essential steps for <a href='#3'>comparing attributes on different scales</a>. We will understand the difference between these processes and when to apply each. In the end, we will have data ready for <a href='#3'>more accurate and meaningful analyses</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "## <a href='#4'>Visualization with Grouped Bar Charts (Binning)</a>\n",
    "Visualization is a powerful tool in data analysis. We will cover the <a href='#4'>binning technique</a>, which groups data into intervals, allowing for a clearer and interpretable representation. Get ready to create <a href='#4'>grouped bar charts</a> that reveal patterns and trends in your datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## <a href='#5'>Categorical Data Conversion</a>\n",
    "Not all algorithms can directly handle categorical data. We will learn to <a href='#5'>convert these variables into numerical indicators</a>, making them compatible with a wide range of analytical techniques. This step is vital to ensure that all aspects of your dataset contribute to robust analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## <a href=\"#6\">Apendix</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this project, we focus not only on performing tasks but also on understanding the reasons behind each step. Are we ready? Let's begin exploring and enhancing our data analysis skills!\n"

    "# Importing the Necessary Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's import the necessary libraries to start our project. Although a detailed explanation of this step is not included in this work, it is important to understand that importing libraries is a common practice in Python programming. To deepen this knowledge, we recommend exploring online resources such as the official Python documentation ([Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)) and specific tutorials available on learning platforms such as Coursera itself or sites like W3Schools. This skill will be valuable throughout the project and in future explorations in data analysis.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. **Download the file:**\n",
    "   - Visit the [Student Mental Health](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shariful07/student-mental-health) link on Kaggle.\n",
    "   - Download the available CSV file on the page.\n",
    "2. **Save the file on your machine:**\n",
    "   - After downloading, save the file in an accessible location on your machine.\n",
    "3. **Update the path in the code:**\n",
    "   - If you saved the file in a different directory, adjust the file path in the code to reflect the correct location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can use the file I provided in the same project directory on GitHub. However, downloading the file from Kaggle is recommended as it provides additional information about the data that can be useful. This procedure is essential to ensure that the code works correctly and that you can explore the dataset effectively.\n"

    "### 2.3.1 CGPA Column: Dealing with Interval Values\n",
    "\n",
    "While exploring the CGPA column, we noticed that the data is presented in a metric format, representing intervals such as '3.00 - 3.49', '3.50 - 4.00', etc. These intervals suggest specific ranges of Cumulative Grade Point Averages (CGPA), providing an overview of students' academic performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to make these intervals more numerically meaningful, we will turn to the use of regular expressions (regex). Let's understand how this works:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding Regular Expressions Simply:\n",
    "Regular expressions, or regex, are character patterns that make it easier to search and manipulate texts. In the context of the CGPA column, where values are in the format '3.00 - 3.49', the simple regular expression ```\\d+\\.\\d+``` helps us extract the numbers contained therein.\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\d: represents any digit from 0 to 9.\n",
    "- +: indicates that the preceding character (in our case, \\d) can appear one or more times.\n",
    "- \\.: searches for a decimal point, preceded by a backslash to be interpreted literally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having said that, our next step is to convert these \"textual intervals\" into more representative numeric values. We understand that each interval covers a range of values, and to simplify the analysis, we will assume the average of this interval as its representative value. If you haven't grasped what this means yet, we will look for a value within the presented interval values, and this value will be the average between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Choosing the Right Technique:\n",
    "As we've seen, the ```cgpa``` column has its data in textual (string) format, and we need to extract the numbers presented there. So, for extracting numbers from strings, using regular expressions is a common and powerful choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How to Use:\n",
    "Understanding the pattern of the data we are trying to extract is helpful. In our case, the pattern was presented as we explained what regular expressions are. There are online resources and Python libraries, like re, that provide assistance in creating regular expressions. The intention is not to teach how to solve all possible cases, but to show the way data can be presented and how it impacts the choice of treatment in a given situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we've created a function called ```calculate_average```. This function uses the re library (regular expressions) to extract all decimal numbers (\\d+\\.\\d+) from a string representing an interval, such as '3.00 - 3.49'. The function then converts these numbers to float format and calculates the average between them."

    "\n",
    "João is 180 centimeters tall, while Maria is 160 centimeters tall. If we try to directly compare these numbers, it may seem like João is much taller than Maria. However, this conclusion could be misleading if we do not consider the natural variation in average heights among different groups of people. Each person is unique, and physical characteristics can vary independently of gender.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that we are using these heights in a dataset, like a large puzzle with many different pieces. Without standardization or normalization, we might face a challenge similar to trying to solve the puzzle using only one color, as if height were the only important piece.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without these adjustment processes (normalization and standardization), our \"rules\" (or algorithms) can become a bit unbalanced, giving more importance to height than to other equally relevant characteristics, such as specific biological features. It's as if we were judging someone's ability solely based on height, completely ignoring their other unique characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardization and normalization play a relevant and essential role in comparing attributes, ensuring that all contribute equitably to the analyses. The absence of these processes can lead to biased conclusions, as some variables may exert disproportionate influence due to their original scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardization and normalization techniques not only facilitate the interpretation of results but also improve algorithm convergence, making the analysis more precise and meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, our approach not only addresses data absence but also ensures that when comparing different characteristics, we are considering their contributions fairly and objectively.\n",

    "We use normalization to compare quantities that exhibit different magnitudes or scales. This practice aims to place variables on a common scale, ensuring that none of them exerts a disproportionate influence on the analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "While exploring our dataset, we notice variables such as `age`, `weight_kg`, and `height_cm` that have different magnitudes. Normalization is a useful technique in this context as it allows us to compare and interpret these variables more intuitively and fairly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the following data for three students:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Student | Age | Weight (kg) | Height (cm) |\n",
    "|---------|-----|-------------|-------------|\n",
    "| A       | 18  | 70          | 180         |\n",
    "| B       | 22  | 65          | 160         |\n",
    "| C       | 19  | 75          | 170         |\n",
    "\n",
    "Observing these values directly, it may be challenging to compare the relative influence of each variable due to their different scales. For example, age has values in the range of tens, while weight and height are in the range of units and hundreds, respectively.\n",

    "```Normalized Value = (Original Value - Minimum Value) / (Maximum Value - Minimum Value)```\n",

    "| C       | 0.25              | 1.0                  | 0.5                  |\n",

    "\n",
    "Now, we will observe a step that aims to simplify the representation of continuous variables. Instead of dealing with individual values, binning organizes these values into discrete intervals or \"bins\". This approach facilitates the interpretation and visualization of data, allowing the identification of patterns and trends more clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Binning** is a fundamental stage that provides an organized way of dealing with continuous variables. This technique is especially useful in scenarios where categorizing information can result in substantial improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implications**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The lack of binning can result in the loss of important information, especially when dealing with algorithms or analyses that benefit from clearer categorizations.\n",
    "- Binning facilitates interpretation by grouping continuous values into intervals or \"bins,\" making patterns more evident and simplifying the communication of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will explore the practical application of binning, using specific examples such as the variable \"age,\" where we will divide the values of the age column into groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "When performing binning, it is necessary to <a href=\"#binning\">be careful in choosing appropriate interval ranges</a> for the variable in question. The effectiveness of grouping depends directly on this selection, impacting subsequent interpretation. Let's explore the binning process in a generalized and didactic way.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, we will perform a simple distribution. The division into groups, such as \"Young,\" \"Young Adult,\" and \"Adult,\" is arbitrary and was made based on equally spaced boundaries and does not reflect the actual ages contained in the data frame. This is a simplification for educational purposes, but in practice, the choice of bin limits can be more complex and based on exploratory data analysis.\n"

    "Consider the last presented graph, and suppose that upon obtaining the dataset, we already have prior information that students aged between 18 and 20 years (including these age ranges) are more likely to attend the library. However, by observing the total number of students in the dataset, we cannot assess whether this group is significantly large or small relative to the total. By performing grouping and visualizing the graph, it becomes evident that the age range (18-20) is more than twice as large as the other group, providing a clearer perspective on the age distribution of students and highlighting the relevance of grouping to identify significant differences between age groups.\n",

    "As we continue to delve into data manipulation and preparation, we will now explore the conversion of categorical variables into indicators. This step aims to make these variables accessible to machine learning algorithms. This is a step that broadens the range of analytical techniques we can apply robustly to our dataset, contributing to our mission of understanding and obtaining insights from raw data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Converting categorical variables into indicators ensures that the variables are in the appropriate format.\n",
    "- Choosing the correct data types not only optimizes computational performance but also facilitates mathematical operations and contributes to a clearer interpretation of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implications**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Failure to perform conversion can result in inconsistencies in results, compromising the reliability of analyses.\n",
    "- Standardizing data types facilitates interpretation and execution of specific operations, enhancing the effectiveness of analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will explore type conversion in our dataset, using the ```have_depression``` column as a practical example. We will highlight the importance of this step in the manipulation and analysis process, exemplifying how this transformation contributes to the understanding and utility of the data. Let's analyze this column and determine the best approach in the process.\n"

    "As we encounter different types of variables throughout this project, it is essential to address the issue of categorical variables, which assume qualitative values. Our focus now turns to the \"```have_depression```n\" column, a binary variable that reflects whether a student has depression or not. We chose this column due to its binary nature (YES, NO) and because it is a common representation in many datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current task directs us to convert the ```have_depression``` column into two distinct indicator variables: ```have_depression_Yes``` and ```have_depression_No```. This operation will not only optimize the representation of this data but also serve as a practical and educational example of how this conversion can be applied to other similar variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this step, we will be able to assess how this transformation impacts our view of the dataset, contributing to the ongoing evolution of the analysis. Let's now explore this conversion.\n"

    "**Utilization of Indicators:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The generated indicators, represented by the columns \"has_depression_No\" and \"has_depression_Yes,\" will be useful for modeling and data analysis in contexts where binary categorical variables are relevant. This transformation enables more effective integration with machine learning algorithms, which often require the numerical representation of variables.\n",

    "\n",
    "**1. Predictive Modeling:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression or decision trees, often require binary variables as input. These indicators provide a suitable representation for the \"has_depression\" attribute, allowing the efficient application of these algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Exploratory Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Facilitate the visualization and interpretation of data. For example, we can analyze the distribution of students with and without depression in different categories, exploring patterns and trends. As an illustrative example, let's assume we have an additional column called \"academic_performance\" with values like \"Good\" and \"Poor.\" We can now explore how academic performance is related to the presence or absence of depression.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Comparison and Filtering:**\n",

    "   - Enable direct comparisons between groups of students with and without depression. This is useful for understanding how different factors may be related to mental health conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generalization to Other Variables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This process of conversion to indicators can be extended to other binary categorical variables in the dataset, offering a consistent and effective approach in its preparation so that we can perform more advanced analyses.\n",

    "By recognizing the importance of this step and understanding its applicability, we ensure that our data is ready for use in robust analytical applications. This contributes to achieving more comprehensive and accurate analyses.\n"

    "<h2 id=\"seed\">7.1 Understanding the Random Seed</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "In data science, it may be necessary to generate random numbers. However, to ensure consistency in results across different code executions, we use the random seed.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Analogy with Boxes and Balls:***\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine we have several boxes, each containing a unique line of colored balls. Each time we draw a ball, the order is determined by the box itself. Here, the boxes represent different pseudo-random sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The random seed is like choosing a specific box to start with. If we choose the same box (same seed) every time, we will draw the balls in the same order, as if they were patiently lined up, waiting to be drawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Practical Example:***\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider two boxes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Box 1 (Seed = 1): Blue, green, purple balls.\n",
    "- Box 2 (Seed = 2): Purple, blue, green balls.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we opt for Box 1 (seed = 1) `np.random.seed(1)`, we will draw the balls in the sequence blue, green, purple. If another person chooses the same Box 1, they will also draw the balls in the same predefined order. Analogously, if we opt for Box 2 (seed = 2) `np.random.seed(2)`, the sequence will be purple, blue, green, and anyone choosing Box 2 will draw the same predefined sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The random seed (`np.random.seed(1)`) provides consistency, as if the balls were always arranged in a line, waiting to be drawn in the same order, regardless of who is drawing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures the reproducibility of results, meaning no matter who \"runs\" the table we created, the results obtained will always be the same. This provides a solid foundation for comparable and reproducible analyses.\n",

    "<h2 id=\"remove_columns\">7.2 Decision on Columns Post Standardization - Keep or Remove?</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>7.2.1 Keep the Original Columns:</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuitive Interpretation:**\n",
    "- If the direct interpretation of the original (non-standardized) values is more relevant to the target audience, it may be useful to keep the original columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visualization:**\n",
    "- In some visualizations, it is more natural to work with data in their original scales. Keeping the original columns facilitates the creation of understandable graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>7.2.2 Remove the Original Columns:</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Space Saving:**\n",
    "- If space economy or simplification of the dataset is a priority, removing the original columns after standardization may be beneficial.\n",
    "- Redundancy Prevention: In some cases, keeping the original columns may be redundant, especially if all subsequent analyses are based on standardized data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>7.3 Hybrid Approach:</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Selective Choice:**\n",
    "- One can choose to keep only the standardized columns or, in an exploratory context, keep both versions for comparative analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the decision will depend on the nature of your project, presentation requirements, and specific preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2 id='normalization'>7.4 More on Normalization</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalization is often used when preparing data for machine learning algorithms. Here are some reasons why this process is emphasized:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comparable Scales:** Algorithms using distance measures can be influenced by the scale of the data. Normalization puts all variables on a comparable scale, preventing a variable with a larger scale from dominating the influence on results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Faster Convergence:** Optimization algorithms, such as those used in neural networks, often converge faster on normalized data. This can lead to more efficient model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mitigated Outlier Influence:** Normalization helps reduce the influence of outliers by putting all data on a more uniform scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **More Intuitive Interpretation:** When data is normalized, the interpretation of coefficients or weights of the model becomes more intuitive, as variables are on comparable scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Preparation for Specific Algorithms:** Some algorithms, like neural networks, are sensitive to the scale of the data. Normalizing data helps create a more suitable input for these algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We suggest further research if the reader wants to know more details than what has been mentioned above.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2 id=\"binning\">7.5 Considerations on Binning</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "Before performing grouping (binning), we need to determine the appropriate interval range for the variable to be analyzed. The choice of interval range directly affects data interpretation and the effectiveness of grouping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some considerations when determining the interval range:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Domain Understanding:** Knowing the context of the problem and understanding the nature of the variable is necessary. For example, when grouping ages, it may be interesting to choose meaningful intervals, such as common age ranges (e.g., 0-18, 19-35, 36-50, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Distribution:** If the data is concentrated in a narrow range, it may be useful to choose smaller intervals to capture specific details. If the data is more dispersed, larger intervals may be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Analytical Objectives:** Consider the specific objectives of the analysis. Sometimes, broader intervals are chosen to provide an overview, while smaller intervals may be needed for more detailed analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Relevance to the Target Audience:** Think about the target audience of the analysis. Meaningful and understandable intervals for the audience make interpretation more accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before implementing grouping, conducting exploratory data analysis can help inform the choice of the most appropriate interval range, however, this aspect is not included in the scope of this project.\n"
