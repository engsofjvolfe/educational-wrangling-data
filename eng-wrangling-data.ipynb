    "# Data Analysis: Educational Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Data Analysis Lab! In this educational project, we aim to explore crucial concepts that form the foundation of data manipulation and analysis. This project is based on the <a href='https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python'>Data Analysis with Python</a> course on the Coursera platform. The topic discussed here relates to the second week of the course and involves the practical application of concepts using a dataset collected from Kaggle: <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shariful07/student-mental-health'>Student Mental health</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this project, we will have acquired essential skills to handle missing data, adjust data types as needed, standardize and normalize relevant attributes, visualize data through <a href='#4'>grouped bar charts using binning</a>, and convert categorical data into numerical indicator variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "We sincerely thank Coursera for providing not only a comprehensive and accessible educational platform but also for offering financial support (<a href='https://www.coursera.org/financial-aid'>financial aid</a>) that enables participation in this course. We express our deep gratitude to the community, whose sharing of knowledge and mutual support significantly enriches the learning experience for everyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "## <a href='#1'>Handling Missing Data</a>\n",
    "Robust data analysis requires the ability to effectively deal with missing data. There are various approaches to this challenge, from <a href='#1'>excluding incomplete entries</a> to <a href='#1'>imputing missing values</a>. We will explore these techniques, highlighting their applications and practical considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## <a href='#2'>Data Type Correction</a>\n",
    "Consistency in data types is crucial. In this lab, we will learn to <a href='#2'>identify and correct inappropriate data types</a>, ensuring that each variable is correctly interpreted. This is essential to avoid analysis errors and misinterpretation of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## <a href='#3'>Standardization and Normalization</a>\n",
    "Standardizing and normalizing data are essential steps for <a href='#3'>comparing attributes on different scales</a>. We will understand the difference between these processes and when to apply each. In the end, we will have data ready for <a href='#3'>more accurate and meaningful analyses</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "## <a href='#4'>Visualization with Grouped Bar Charts (Binning)</a>\n",
    "Visualization is a powerful tool in data analysis. We will cover the <a href='#4'>binning technique</a>, which groups data into intervals, allowing for a clearer and interpretable representation. Get ready to create <a href='#4'>grouped bar charts</a> that reveal patterns and trends in your datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## <a href='#5'>Categorical Data Conversion</a>\n",
    "Not all algorithms can directly handle categorical data. We will learn to <a href='#5'>convert these variables into numerical indicators</a>, making them compatible with a wide range of analytical techniques. This step is vital to ensure that all aspects of your dataset contribute to robust analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this project, we focus not only on performing tasks but also on understanding the reasons behind each step. Are we ready? Let's begin exploring and enhancing our data analysis skills!\n"

    "# Importing the Necessary Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's import the necessary libraries to start our project. Although a detailed explanation of this step is not included in this work, it is important to understand that importing libraries is a common practice in Python programming. To deepen this knowledge, we recommend exploring online resources such as the official Python documentation ([Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)) and specific tutorials available on learning platforms such as Coursera itself or sites like W3Schools. This skill will be valuable throughout the project and in future explorations in data analysis.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. **Download the file:**\n",
    "   - Visit the [Student Mental Health](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shariful07/student-mental-health) link on Kaggle.\n",
    "   - Download the available CSV file on the page.\n",
    "2. **Save the file on your machine:**\n",
    "   - After downloading, save the file in an accessible location on your machine.\n",
    "3. **Update the path in the code:**\n",
    "   - If you saved the file in a different directory, adjust the file path in the code to reflect the correct location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can use the file I provided in the same project directory on GitHub. However, downloading the file from Kaggle is recommended as it provides additional information about the data that can be useful. This procedure is essential to ensure that the code works correctly and that you can explore the dataset effectively.\n"

This practice aims to improve code readability and facilitate data manipulation, especially during programming processes. We will also use Brazilian Portuguese names for better readability in this context.\n",

The consistent use of \"nan\" as the default representation brings benefits in terms of consistency and compatibility in numerical operations. It's not necessary to deeply understand these details; the key point is that using \"nan\" as the missing value representation is preferable to other representations.\n",

If some of these values are missing, we can fill them with the mean of the variable.\n",
